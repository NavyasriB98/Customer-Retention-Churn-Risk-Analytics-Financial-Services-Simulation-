Customer Churn Prediction Project This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to analyze and predict customer churn in the telecom industry. It includes modules for synthetic data generation, messy data cleaning, feature engineering, predictive modeling, and risk scoring. ## 📋 Overview The goal of this project is to simulate a real-world data science workflow:  **Clean & Process**: Handle missing values, standardize inconsistent labels, and engineer new features. 3. **Train Model**: Build a Random Forest classifier to learn patterns associated with customer churn. 4. **Score & Export**: Apply the model to the full dataset to assign churn probabilities and risk profiles for downstream analysis (e.g., Power BI dashboards). ## 🚀 Key Features * **Robust Data Cleaning**: * Imputes missing values (e.g., TotalCharges) using median strategies. * Standardizes categorical entries (e.g., correcting 'fiber', 'Fiber', 'M', 'Male'). * **Feature Engineering**: * Creates tenure cohorts (TenureGroup) for better segmentation. * Calculates total charges based on monthly rates and tenure. * **Predictive Modeling**: * Uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict churn. * Provides classification metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall) and Feature Importance analysis. * **Risk Categorization**: * **Low Risk**: Probability < 30% * **Medium Risk**: 30% ≤ Probability < 70% * **High Risk**: Probability ≥ 70% ## 📂 Project Structure * churn_pipeline.py: The main script containing the entire ETL and modeling pipeline. * churn_modeling_output.csv: The final output file containing cleaned data, ground truth labels, predicted probabilities, and risk categories. ## 🛠️ Installation & Requirements Ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:
bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
## 🏃‍♂️ Usage Run the pipeline script directly from your terminal:
bash
python churn_pipeline.py
### Script Workflow: 1. **Generates** 5,000 records of synthetic customer data. 2. **Cleans** the data (fixes typos, fills NaNs). 3. **Trains** the model on a subset of the data. 4. **Evaluates** model performance and prints the report. 5. **Scores** the entire dataset with churn probabilities. 6. **Exports** the results to churn_modeling_output.csv. ## 📊 Output Data Dictionary The generated churn_modeling_output.csv includes: | Column | Description | | :--- | :--- | | CustomerID | Unique identifier for the customer | | Tenure | Number of months the customer has stayed with the company | | MonthlyCharges | The amount charged to the customer monthly | | TotalCharges | The total amount charged to the customer | | Churn | **Target Variable**: Whether the customer churned or not (Yes/No) | | Churn_Probability | **Model Output**: Predicted probability of churning (0.0 to 1.0) | | Risk_Category | **Model Output**: Risk-based segmentation (Low, Medium, High) |
